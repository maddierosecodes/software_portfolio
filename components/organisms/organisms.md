# Organisms

## Atomic Design System

### What are organisms?

Organisms are components which are _ready to use_ in our layouts and pages. They are **contextualised** combinations of smaller elements, predominantly molecules, but also atoms and bosons.

For example:

- A form is a molecule, but a contact form which submits it's data to the back end is a organisms.
- A hero section is a molecule, but a hero section which contains the authors name and photo is an organism
- A nav bar is a molecule, but the page header with fixed page navigation is an organism.
