# Molecules

## Atomic Design System

### What are molecules?

Molecules are the bread and butter of our app. They combine smaller elements, for us, that's bosons and atoms, to create a component which _stands alone_ to function. However, the key thing about molecules is, they're **unopinionated**. Molecules are not seeded with any contextual information. At the point that they are, they become an organism. So, our example molecules, could each become organisms if we were using them for a specific purpose

For example:

- A form is a molecule, but a contact form which submits it's data to the back end is a organisms.
- A hero section is a molecule, but a hero section which conatains the authors name and photo is an organism
- A nav bar is a molecule, but the page header with fixed page navigation is an organism.
