# Atoms
## Atomic Design System

### What are atoms?

Atoms are the *Smallest* components which affect *behaviour*. Whilst bosons (style), and in some systems (but __NOT__ ours), quarks,  are smaller, atoms are the smallest components. A good example of an atom is a __button__. But not just *any* button will do. This should be a purposeful button. 

For example:
- a call to action button 
- a next or previous button
- a submit button 

This helps us to keep a consistent design, without becoming either too general, or too specialised!
